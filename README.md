# 📊 Customer Churn Classification using Machine Learning

This project uses the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will leave the telecom company or not.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major issue in telecom industries. Being able to predict which customers are at risk of leaving allows companies to implement retention strategies.

In this project:
- We preprocess customer data
- Apply a **Random Forest Classifier**
- Evaluate the model using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall**
- Visualize results using a **confusion matrix heatmap**

---

**Features include:**
- Demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen)
- Service details (e.g., internet service, contract type)
- Account details (e.g., monthly charges, tenure)
- Target label: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab
